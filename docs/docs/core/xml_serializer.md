## Broadworks_OCIP\core\Serializer\XMLSerializer

The Serializer is very much a magic class. It converts XML into a ComplexType such as UserGetResponse17sp4 and returns it.
The type of object returned is decided by passing a parameter into the constructor of the type requested so it knows what object to build.
